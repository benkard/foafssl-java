 Neither Shibboleth nor OpenID follow the principles of REST, which makes it difficult to gain
 extra information about a user in the decentralized ways of the Web.
 
 This paper proposes a novel, secure approach which relies on combining the use of TLS client 
 certificates and Semantic-Web-based FOAF networks. The result is a secure, open and distributed authentication mechanism, which is able
 to satisfy simple requirements ---such as authenticating a user as by URI, like OpenID--- and
-more complex requirements, where the authorization to a service depends on knowledge of the position in the social network of the authenticating agent, as inferred from documents containing FOAF relations --- though this can be extended to any information in any vocabulary relevant to the authorization decision. This is possible because the protocol is essentially RESTful, and thus in concordance with the architecture of the Web, the biggest most successful network ever of distributed linked information.

 REST specifies the architectural style required for building such a protocol, with the aim of maximum networkability; that is, any representation should be able to link to any resource from anywhere using the URI alone to do so. Moreover, any user should be able to reach any part of the system in such a way.

+Whereas URLs in the initial web of hyperlinked documents referred only to documents, the Semantic Web specifies how to extend this to enable a web of interlinked resources. In the Semantic Web, it becomes possible for URLs to refer to anything, be it:
 \begin{enumerate}
 \item concrete things like individual people --- e.g. {\tt <http://romeo.net/\#i>} refers to a human named Romeo;
 \item relations between 2 individuals --- e.g. the relation of knowing someone which {\tt <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows>} refers to;
 \item or classes --- e.g. the set of people: {\tt <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person>}.

-The meaning of these URLs can be found by dereferencing them using their canonical protocol. Thus, doing an HTTP GET on {\tt <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows>} should return a representation describing it. As HTTP is built to allow content negotiation, clever web servers will return the representation best fitting the client's needs. Entering the URL cited above in a web browser will indeed return a human readable web page describing the `knows' relation. A semantic web agent could ask for the standard machine-friendly RDF/XML representation and parse it; yet other representations could be returned to describe the same information.

-By giving oneself a URL --~{\em aka.} a WebId~-- one can can describe one's personal social network by linking oneself to one's acquaintances by reference. Therefore, if someone had been given the {\tt romeo:i} URL above by Romeo himself, and had found its {\tt log:semantics}, there is good reason for him to trust that the information there is correct, and thus to merge it (in a defeasible manner) with his own belief store. As that graph itself contains further URIs such as {\tt jult:me}'s, the agent could also get its {\tt log:semantics} to find out more about its referent. The thought then is that, if {\em romeo:i} uses a URI, it is because he means to refer to the thing objectively referred to by that URI. By following the canonical way to dereference that URI one should get a representation of that thing. Meaning is objective.

 If the advantages gained by keeping information up-to-date is large enough, a peer-to-peer information network arises, where each person specializes in keeping the information they understand up-to-date and links to the best sources for objects he or she does not control. Current social networking sites such as Facebook and LinkedIn, and older ones such as eBay, have shown how this can work in less distributed settings. In return, as the quality of one's links become better, people will feel more comfortable linking to it. Furthermore, there is an incentive to link to existing resources: less work maintaining that information.

+that {\tt S} can consider {\tt romeo:i owl:sameAs \_:client}.
+In particular {\tt romeo:i} cannot repudiate this assertion since {\tt romeo:i} 
+itself provided P\ref{prop:foafRomeoSt} authoritatively (when being dereferenced).
 
-It follows then that if {\tt S} has to serve R to {\tt romeo:i} then {\tt romeo:i} cannot disagree if {\tt S} serves {\tt R} to {\tt \_:client} . And this is all that {\tt S} needs to know to accomplish its task.
+%In other words, both {\tt romeo:i} and {\tt \_:client} would agree, given what {\tt S} knows, that they are the same. The advantage of this reasoning via an indirection of what others would have to agree to given what S knows, is that it allows {\tt S} to assert the minimum it needs to, and so be minimally liable.
 
-It is an interesting further question to find out if S also knows that {\tt romeo:i = \_:client}, but we have not at present had enough time to look into this.
